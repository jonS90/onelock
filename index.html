<p>One Lock to rule them all! This is a chrome extension which brings a new model of security to normal web applications.</p>

<h4>
<a id="why-does-this-exist" class="anchor" href="#why-does-this-exist" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why does this exist?</h4>

<p>Today's web applications run on trust. You have to trust them to protect your privacy and protect your information from malicious hackers. The problem is, violations of trust happen from time to time despite many best efforts.</p>

<p>When a web service transmits a message from you to a friend, there's a lot of potential holes along the way where it can be leaked or stolen. Rather than trust every web-service to secure every little hole, why not trust one little tool to secure the whole thing at once? OneLock is that tool (well, it's a prototype). It eliminates the need to trust web apps. You decide who can see you're stuff because it's encrypted and it can only be decrypted by <em>intended</em> recipients.</p>

<p>This kind of encryption is called public-key cryptography. It's been around for a while, and has been widely used in other areas. It's never been ported to general web applications, but now, there is OneLock!</p>

<p>OneLock is experimental. Please don't count on it. Future updates may erase your contacts and settings.</p>
