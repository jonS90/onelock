pgp-for-chrome
==============

A chrome extension which permits a new model of security for web applications.

### Why does this exist?

Today's web applications need you to trust them. Chatting with your friend over Facebook, you're trusting Facebook to protect the conversation you're routing through Facebook's servers. When a web application distributes your data to the wrong people, or lets malicious hackers get at it, your trust is violated and you might not like others seeing your stuff. PGP-for-Chrome eliminates that need for trust. 

How? Well, it's all in the name. PGP is a program folks use to to encrypt stuff so that only the intended recipients are capable of decrypting it. That way, it doesn't matter if the servers are insecure. PGP-for-Chrome brings this model of encryption to general web-browsing; it no longer matters how untrustworthy a web-application is. Only you decide who can decrypt your stuff.
