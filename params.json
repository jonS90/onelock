{"name":"OneLock","tagline":"Introducing an interesting model of internet security","body":"OneLock\r\n==============\r\n\r\nThis is a chrome extension which brings an interesting model of security to normal web applications.\r\n\r\n### Why does this exist?\r\n\r\nToday's web applications run on trust. To use them, you must trust them to respect your privacy and actively protect it against malicious hackers. The problem is, violations of trust happen from time to time despite many best efforts.\r\n\r\nWhen a web service transmits a message from you to a friend, there are many potential holes along the way where it can be leaked or stolen. You trust *each* web-service to secure *each* hole. What if, instead, you trusted *one* tool of yours to secure the whole thing? OneLock is that tool (well, it's a prototype). **It eliminates the need to trust web apps**. Only you decide who can see your stuff because you encrypt it and only *intended* recipients can decrypt it.\r\n\r\nThis kind of encryption is called public-key cryptography. It's been around for a while, and has been widely used in other areas. To my knowledge, it's never been molded onto general web applications until now.\r\n\r\nOneLock is experimental. Please don't count on it. Future updates may erase your contacts and settings.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
