{"name":"OneLock","tagline":"Introducing a better model of internet security","body":"OneLock\r\n==============\r\n\r\nOne Lock to rule them all! This is a chrome extension which brings a new model of security to normal web applications.\r\n\r\n#### Why does this exist?\r\n\r\nToday's web applications run on trust. You have to trust them to protect your privacy and protect your information from malicious hackers. The problem is, violations of trust happen from time to time despite many best efforts.\r\n\r\nWhen a web service transmits a message from you to a friend, there's a lot of potential holes along the way where it can be leaked or stolen. Rather than trust every web-service to secure every little hole, why not trust one little tool to secure the whole thing at once? OneLock is that tool (well, it's a prototype). It eliminates the need to trust web apps. You decide who can see you're stuff because it's encrypted and it can only be decrypted by *intended* recipients.\r\n\r\nThis kind of encryption is called public-key cryptography. It's been around for a while, and has been widely used in other areas. It's never been ported to general web applications, but now, there is OneLock!\r\n\r\nOneLock is experimental. Please don't count on it. Future updates may erase your contacts and settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
