The keyring structure has been abstracted away by keyring.js. We can just accept that it's magic. 

Key entries themselves have not been abstracted away (though they probably ought to be). Their structure is planned as follows:

KeyEntry
{
	signedName: String,
	publicKey: String,
	[privateKey: String]
}
